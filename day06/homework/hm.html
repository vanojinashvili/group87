    <!-- info about basketball -->
    <P>Basketball is a <b> team sport in which two teams of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court,</b>
        <br><br>
        compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball <strong>(approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop
        (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.05 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court).</strong> Teams alternate between offense, when they attempt to score,
        and defense, when they try to prevent the opposing side from scoring. <i>A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul,
        timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws.</i>
        <u>The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied,
        an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.</u> <mark>However, if the additional period still results in a tied score, yet another additional period is mandated.</mark>
        This goes on until the score is not tied anymore.</P>
